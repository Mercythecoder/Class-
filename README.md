🧠 Code Overview
The code flow includes:

User Input

Prompts for two numbers and converts them to float for decimal operations.

Calculations

Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on those numbers.

Output

Nicely formatted results printed to the console with emoji flair.

💡 Notes & Tips
Division by zero warning: The script doesn’t currently handle zero–division errors, so avoid entering 0 as the second number to prevent exceptions.

Improvements you can try:

Add error handling using try-except blocks.

Wrap logic into reusable functions or a Calculator class.

Implement a loop to allow multiple rounds of calculations.

Extend the interface with a GUI (e.g., using tkinter).
